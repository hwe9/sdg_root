Service Startup Failures (Deploy Blockers):
Bug #3: AUTH service missing DATABASE_URL environment variable

Bug #17: Import error in data processing service (from .core.db_utils)

Critical Security Vulnerabilities:
Bug #1: Database password exposed in plaintext in .env file

Bug #2: Auth service port 8005 exposed to external networks

Bug #7: SSRF vulnerability in URL retrieval (no validation)

Bug #9: Potential SQL injection in database queries

Bug #13: Hardcoded fallback secret key for JWT tokens

üìã Step-by-Step Bug Analysis
Configuration & Infrastructure (4 bugs)
Password Exposure: Database credentials hardcoded in configuration

Network Security: Services exposed without proper isolation

Missing Variables: Environment variables not propagated to all services

Resource Limits: Incomplete container resource configuration

Data Retrieval Service (4 bugs)
Infinite Loop: No circuit breaker for persistent failures

Race Condition: File locking applied after file opening

SSRF Attack: Direct URL requests without validation

Memory Leak: Large JSON objects not cleaned up

API Service (4 bugs)
SQL Injection: Direct text() queries without proper parameterization

Connection Leak: Database sessions not closed on exceptions

DoS Vulnerability: No input size limits on content submission

Error Handling: Inconsistent exception handling across endpoints

Authentication Service (2 bugs)
Secret Key: Predictable fallback for JWT signing

Data Loss: User data stored in memory (lost on restart)

Content Extraction Service (2 bugs)
Async Error: Non-async function called with await

Resource Leak: Network connections not properly cleaned up

Data Processing Service (2 bugs)
Import Error: Relative imports in non-package context

Deadlock Risk: Complex database transactions without error handling

‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment
SEVERE (Immediate Threat)
Complete system compromise via exposed credentials

Authentication bypass via hardcoded secrets

Service startup failures preventing deployment

HIGH (Production Impact)
Data corruption from race conditions

Resource exhaustion from memory/connection leaks

Security breaches via injection attacks

MEDIUM (Operational Issues)
Service instability from poor error handling

Performance degradation from resource leaks

Data loss from persistence issues

üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Fix Priority
Priority 1 - DEPLOY BLOCKERS
Fix bugs #3, #17, #1 immediately - these prevent system startup or pose immediate security risks.

Priority 2 - SECURITY CRITICAL
Address bugs #2, #7, #9, #13 - these create attack vectors for malicious actors.

Priority 3 - STABILITY CRITICAL
Resolve bugs #5, #8, #10, #14 - these cause resource exhaustion and data loss.

Priority 4+ - OPERATIONAL
Handle remaining bugs for code quality and long-term maintainability.
